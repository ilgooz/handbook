# Communication

[[toc]]

## Internal

### Daily discussions

Daily discussions happen on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SaZ5HcE)

Make sure to have the role `team` in order to access internal team discussion channels - [See the list of all roles](/marketing/#chat)

Conversations may happen on Telegram but try to avoid this. If necessary, limit them to 1-on-1 conversations as Telegram is not user friendly for group conversations

### Task related discussion

Discussions related to a specific work task should happen on [Monday](https://mesg.monday.com).

Discussions with coworkers will happen on Discord or in person, but make sure to log updates and deliverables on Monday.

## External

Discussions with persons outside of MESG can vary depending of the preferences of the person(s). Try to always prioritize the channel of communication in this way:

- **Email**: Easy to track and search. Easy to forward and have people who join (using cc), bad for real-time discussions
- **Telegram**: Good for real-time discussions, hard to search
- **Skype**: Good for voice conversations, very hard to track

Make sure to use the best tool based on your needs. Also when a conversation is interesting, make **sure to add the relevant persons** in the discussion.
