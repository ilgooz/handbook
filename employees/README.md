## Time off / Remote work

We care about results more than time. If you can do your entire job in one week, then spend the rest of the month on holiday go for it :smile:.

Holidays are important to release stress and come back with more motivation than ever so, we don't worry much about them.

Also, you might need to take some time for personal reasons, but still want to work or partially work, so make sure to log that the same way than your holidays.

::: tip Notification
For time off and partial time off, make sure to notify the team on time.

Consider a one-week notice for less than a week holiday, and a two-week notice for more.
:::

There are still some rules to ensure that everything works well even when you are not here.

Add it to the company-level calendar [MESG Availabilities](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mesg.tech_36toa09ndvlltajoke45r0v89s%40group.calendar.google.com) with the following format:

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showNav=0&amp;showDate=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=300&amp;wkst=1&amp;src=mesg.tech_36toa09ndvlltajoke45r0v89s%40group.calendar.google.com" style="border-width:0" height="300" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

```
[TYPE] - NAME (reason)
```

*You don't have to provide any **reason** for time off as it might be personal, but if you want to, it's always nice to know where you are.*

Where `TYPE` that can be 
- **OFF**: holiday
- **PART**: part time
- **REMOTE**: working remotely

eg:
- `[REMOTE] Anthony (Escape pollution)`
- `[OFF] Anthony`
- `[PART] Anthony (Visit family)`

::: warning
Make sure that when off, everything you are working on is accessible so you don't hinder any other team member's work flow.

This is **super important** and if it's not respected, this could impact your next holidays.
