### Hackathon

- Audit existing technical onboarding documentation
  - To ensure minimum friction and to limit support interaction, all [existing onboarding material](/ux/) must be audited against previous support engagement and updated accordingly.
- Identify potential strategic partnerships
  - This is not a mandatory step in the process. If an opportunity exists to partner with a particular organization, it could shape the hackathon.
  - Certain existing organizations which may overlap within the hackaton's chosen niche may have a vested interest in the outcome.
  - Identify and approach such potential partners to contribute to the prize allocation as well as creating credibility and awareness.
  - Such a partnership can also help secure high-profile judges.
- Identify hackathon topic/niche
  - The outcome of the hackathon MUST make a material contribution to the five core KPIs.
  - Attempt to overlap with the current or forthcoming Key Vertical.
  - If a hackathon partner has been identified, this will shape the topic.
- Set participation success criteria
  - Research and engage with domain experts in order to determine the judging criteria.
- Bring domain specific judges on board
  - Attempt to secure judges with a solid online profile and following. People with credibility whose online following can be leveraged for pre and post hackathon visibility.
- Create awareness campaign (participation focus)
  - Engage with marketing expert on how to create content and communities and how to engage with these in a way that increases the likelihood of quality participation.
- Create awareness campaign (Investor/trader focus)
  - Marketing campaign that focuses on general awareness of the hackathon and creating credibility for the MESG token.
- Set [Hackthon rules](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kDqppueHXrOs7iKej9NSs0iG0sHpWjo2) and ensure compliance
  - We need to make sure that the hackathon is legal and have terms that participants agree with. Not something really important for offline hackathon but really important for online as many platform like [Devpost](https://devpost.com/) expect to have these legal rules/terms.
- Identify broadcasting platforms
  - Identify all platforms on which to broadcast marketing material related to creating awareness for both driving participation and general interest for non-participants like investors and marketplace consumers.
- Create community channels specific to the hackathon
  - This is likely to be only Discord for instant messaging 
  - Ensure that 24/7 technical support is available
- Live-promote entries on relevant platforms/communities
  - Creating awareness of the entries as the hackathon progresses will stimulate important conversations amongst future participants and token investors.
- Engage with influencers to live-promote entries.
  - An ongoing campaign to involve niche influencers as we see what entrants are busy building. 
  - Creating hype over what entrants are busy building could be an interesting campaign.
- Judge winning entries
  - Marketing material could be mined out of the process.
  - This could also be done through a live stream.
- Announce winners
  - Explore different publication methods of announcing the winners. Potentially in a countdown.
- Broadcast winner announcement on all relevant channels.
  - Broadcast channels established during the early phases of the marketing campaign should be leveraged to ensure maximum exposure of the winners.
  - This could also be done through a live stream.
- Distribute prizes
  - If we give prize in MESG token this will fluctuate based on the market value so we need to make sure to have something clear for that. 
  - Price at the end of the hackathon
  - Price during the distribution (that can happen between x and y days)
- Mine marketing material out of all entries
  - This can be started before the winners are announced.
  - As soon as entries are published, we should seek the input of domain experts and mine compelling content out of the entries.
  - What does the entry mean for the tech world? Why is MESG the ideal platform for this, etc.
  - We could also have an interview with the winners: who they are, what are they doing in their life, why they participated, what was their impression of MESG, etc.
  - If it is a partner Hackathon, we could motivate the partner to promote MESG’s participation.
- Measure hackathon's impact on key metrics
  - This will likely only be visible some time after the entries are finalized. 
  - The four key metrics established in the Adoption Strategy should be monitored to see whether the hackathon has made a material contribution to these numbers.
- Critical assessment of Hackathon successes and failures.
  - What did we do right and what did we do wrong?
  - Get input from the entire MESG team as well as participants.
  - Workshop changes required to subsequent Hackathons.
  - How well as the Hackathon contributed to MESG’s KPIs
