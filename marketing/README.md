  - Blog posts
  - Video posts
  - Developer-centric content

#### Monitoring
#### Inspiration

- Developer-written content is important. Even if it is simply what you are working on and learning.  
- Articles can be written about: 
  - New developments & features
  - Product documentation (a great product is great marketing)
  - Contests
  - The experience of developing on MESG
  - Mistakes made and lessons learned
  - Favorite tools used to develop on MESG
  - Comparing MESG to other tools
  - Responding to current events through the MESG perspective 
  - Bi-weekly development updates
- Provide actual value to our target audience. 
- Choose topics that cause/create tension 
  - e.g. "We screwed up, here's how", "5 reasons our product is better than theirs". 
  - Be critical yet sophisticated and respectful
  - Negative titles, or articles with titles describing why something is terrible are usually more popular than articles that describe why something is great
  - Use numbers in your title: the larger the number, the more likely people will read. (e.g. New Ruby on Rails bug puts 20,000 websites at risk) 
  - Name drop big companies, even if the article doesn't have to do much with a big company. People tend to read articles that mention Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, etc. in the title. 

#### Draft

- A draft should be first created in a Google Doc. 
- Upon finishing, request feedback and a grammar check from the team

#### Review

  - ensure there are no grammar mistakes 
  - ensure it is on-brand, and appealing to our target audience
