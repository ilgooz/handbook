# Meetings

**TL;DR:** Avoid unneccessary meetings but if you need to call a meeting do it efficiently with an agenda

Innovative methods of conducting more effective meetings should be explored:

- [Stand up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)
- [No computers / No phones](https://timemanagementninja.com/2011/09/5-reasons-to-ban-technology-in-your-meeting/)
- [Notes on paper](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/meetings/how-to-take-notes-in-meetings)

## Scheduling and Planning Meetings

If a meeting is necessary, it needs to be planned:
- date
- timeframe
- relevant parties 

::: tip
Meetings should not be longer than 1 hour. Ideally 15min should be enough.
:::

Every meeting should have an [event on Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/eventedit) with relevant parties invited and a Hangouts Meet conference if needed.

## Availability

Make sure that everyone involved in the meeting is available, if not, then the meeting should be postponed. Do not invite anyone who is not directly involved with the meeting agenda.

::: tip
Make sure to edit your timezone especially if you are traveling.

## Goals

Set specific goals for the meeting, always ask yourself the question:

**What exactly is the meeting about?**

If you **can't** answer it, then there is probably **no need** for a meeting.\
If you **can** answer it, then **announce it on the calendar event** to let all the attendees know what the meeting is about so they also have time to adequately prepare

## Notes

Two types of notes should be taken:
- **Outcomes** for the goals set for the meeting
- **Tangents** Important to capture but not in the scope of the meeting

## Measure success

Important KPIs to review at the end of a meeting:

- **Goals achieved** in the meeting (should be 100% :))
- **Duration** of the meeting (should be the one set in the calendar)
