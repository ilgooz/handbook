## Forum

Support inquiries should be directed to the [MESG Forum](https://forum.mesg.com/c/support) - This ultimately reduces the amount of support required for the following reasons:

::: tip
Try to redirect all support inquiries to the Forum
:::

#### Searchable

Every question/answer can be easily found by any search engine

#### Indexable

All topics on the forum are indexable, and so answers become accessible directly through any search engine without needing to ask us directly

#### Community involvement

Anyone on the forum can participate and answer another member's question when we are not available - They can also be promoted to an official moderator

#### Avoid duplication

The forum has a good system to detect repeat questions when a new post is created - This reduces the amount of duplicated/similar questions

#### Resolved discussions

When an answer satisfies a user inquiry, this answer is marked as "resolved" and other users can easily see what to do to resolve a similar issue

## Chat

Support by chat can be done either on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SaZ5HcE) or [Telegram](https://t.me/mesg_community) - Telegram as a support channel is not optimal because users cannot easily find the answer to their questions, creating a lot of duplicated questions

::: tip
When a question appears several times in chat, encourage people to create a new topic on the forum in ["support"](https://forum.mesg.com/c/support) or ["general"](https://forum.mesg.com/c/general).

The next time this question comes up, send the link from the forum as a response

## Email

Direct emails are hard to track and are easy to lose track of - try to avoid this as much as possible

Many people still prefer email as a communication channel. In this case, use a support platform that can aggregate emails and re-direct them to the appropriate parties

Here is a list of such services that could be used:
- [https://www.intercom.com/](https://www.intercom.com/)
- [https://www.zendesk.com/](https://www.zendesk.com/)
- [https://www.helpdesk.com/](https://www.helpdesk.com/)
- [https://www.uservoice.com/](https://www.uservoice.com/)
- [https://hiverhq.com/](https://hiverhq.com/)

::: tip
Make sure to provide a link to the forum when answering emails, and encourage them to ask subsequent questions in the forum
:::

## Phone/Video call

This is time consuming and should be avoided as much as possible

Exceptions for **premium support** can be made on a case-by-case basis for special users or partners

::: tip
Always try to direct conversations to chat or email
