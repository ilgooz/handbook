## Algorithmic Token Distribution
The MESG Foundation will release the circulating supply of MESG Tokens via a system called Algorithmic Token Distribution (ATD) to increase stability and transparency.  

#### Supply limitations

- Software is used to determine the daily real circulating volume
- 0-6% of of the previous day's actual total traded volume (TDTV) will be released into ciruclating supply each day. The exact percentage fluctuates to maintian optimal market health and a minimum 20% supply for MESG Foundation reserves to align longterm incentives. 
- A smart contract is used to ensure no more than 6% TDTV is released, including founder, advisor and whale investor payouts.
- Releasing MESG Tokens based on actual voume protects tokens in slow/bear markets by releasing few. More tokens will be released in faster markets. 

#### Disbursement details

- Of the 0-6% TDTV released, 66.7% will be sold on exchanges at the current market price. The daily unsold tokens, in addition to the remaining 33.3%, will be made available to to the MESG Foundation for direct token distribution.
- For recurring token payouts, the MESG/USD exchange rate will be calculated from the rate at 13:00 (UTC+7) on the first day of the given month from the aggregated exchange rate.
- For non-recurring payouts made before 13:00 (UTC+7) on a given day, the rate will be calculated from the previous dayâ€™s rate at 13:00 (UTC+7) from the aggregated exchange rate.
- For non-recurring payouts made after 13:00 (UTC+7), the rate at 13:00 (UTC+7) from the same day will be used from the aggregated exchange rate.

#### Transparency standards

- The [ATD Dashboard]( https://atd.mesg.com/) is used to promote transparency within the MESG Community. It shows token quanitities within various wallets, in addition to token dispersment rates. 
- Statistics on MESG's ATD Dashboard can be compared against public records such as Etherscan to boost trustworthiness and transparency with the community.


## Exchange Listing
The activities below represent a checklist of involved in getting MESG listed on Token Exchanges.
While a linear process may be implied below, it is accepted that each Exchange interaction won't always follow this exact path. However, this checklist should still be adhered to as much as possible.

Throughout the life-cycle of the Exchange Listing 

####  1. Select an Exchange

-  Yellow will select the ideal Exchange to approach from the pool of pre-approved exchanges in the [MESG Token Exchanges Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ks4YaVGldGDJd73k9IcMx2EDUfKJiKZlHcLBfPDe3mA/edit#gid=0)
-  The engagement priority is reflected in listing order.

#### 2. Engage with Exchange

Yellow will initiate contact and start discussions with the selected Exchange. The purpose of the engagement is to obtain information about listing procedure such as: 

- Listing Price
- Timeframe
- What marketing services they can offer
- Other information that will affect the listing process.

It is imperative that the above information is communicated back to MESG throughout the engagement.

#### 3. MESG and Yellow reach consensus on whether the listing is to be done.

#### 4. MESG completes the application process.

The application process needs to be placed in the [Exchanges folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iRfsJhYntvceBhZnALdW7ckImbSART7j) with a new filter with the name of the exchange and the application form inside

#### 5. Yellow assess and negotiates the Exchange contract. 

Details of this activity must always be communicated to MESG. For instance: which aspects of the contract are problematic, beneficial and what the status of the negotiation is. 
Once this contract is finalized it should go in the [exchange's folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iRfsJhYntvceBhZnALdW7ckImbSART7j) created previously.

#### 6. MESG select listing date.

Yellow's input on this topic will be sought, but the criteria for selecting the listing date will typically involve providing enough time to create marketing material and visibility.

#### 7. MESG to set up marketing effort in conjunction with the Exchange's offerings and Yellow's guidance.

It is likely that the marketing campaigns for all exchange listings will look mostly alike and that Standard Operating Procedures can be designed for these. But, given that some exchanges will provide additional marketing support and will have unique offerings, each listing's marketing campaign will also have a bespoke component.

#### 8. MESG to sign the Exchange Listing contract.

#### 9. MESG to execute Marketing strategy.

This is based on the strategy designed in "7" above.
